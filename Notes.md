LOGIN
- Do you have to worry about clearing the state of the input fields depending on which form you're typing information? Like if you started typing in the new user form, and then changed to th elogin form, but clicked the new user submit form. You don't want to create a new user when  you meant to log yourself in?
- The signup feature does not persist to the backend!!!

LIST
- change list to props when you take hardcoded information out from state.

**STYLE**
- App.js : find a way to make the error message appear on the screen by the form field.
